EEMTL: Effective and Effecient Multi-Task Learning for Dense Predictions

This is the official implementation of:  
1. BridgeNet: Comprehensive and Effective Feature Interactions via Bridge Feature for Multi-task Dense Predictions (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13514)
2. Multi-Task Label Discovery via Hierarchical Task Tokens for Partially Annotated Dense Predictions (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18823)

Code is coming soon~~~
